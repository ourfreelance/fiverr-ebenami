## Opportunities for Potential Students, RAs, and Postdocs

This year, I am actively recruiting motivated Postdocs, PhD, MS students, and potential research assistants with interests in risk prediction and management. In addition, I have opportunities for motivated Virginia Tech undergraduates interested in research.

- Prospective MS and PhD students: Please apply to the Virginia Tech AAEC program [through the normal channels](https://aaec.vt.edu/academics/graduate/visiting.html), and mention my name in your application. Reach out in advance to discuss particular fellowships available for incoming VT students. Funding support for application fees is available for students from low and middle income countries- please indicate this in an email to me. PhD applications for Fall 2022 are due in January. 
- **Current Virginia Tech PhD, MS, and undergraduate students, as well as prospective Postdocs and RAs:** Please send me email describing your research interests, your relevant skills/background, and include your CV/resume. Highest priority will be placed on the projects outlined below though I am open to other projects where you demonstrate thematic alignment with ongoing projects.

## Fit with the Lab

Ideally you can demonstrate that you have and/or are committed to developing your quantitative analysis skills while you remember the social impacts -- that is the people -- represented by your datapoints and analysis. Experience with or interest in either causal inference methods, satellite remote sensing, computational social science and/or prediction policy approaches are fitting for my lab.

&nbsp;

Prospective students can apply through the VT graduate school for the Ag and Applied Econ program (linked [here](https://aaec.vt.edu/academics/graduate.html)). I can also serve on your committee if you're technically homed in another department, and especially if you're part of the [Remote Sensing Interdisciplinary Graduate Education Program (IGEP)](https://rsigep.frec.vt.edu/) or the [Global Change Center IGEP](https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/igc/) -- two unique elements of VT's curriculum offerings.

## Ph.D. Student Funding Opportunities

Please reach out if you're interested in developing research and grant proposals related to the work I do and its extensions, whether as an RA, student, or a postdoc. These often can take time (on the order of several months), so early contact is best. Here's also a sample working list of fellowships that are likely relevant for PhD Students and Postdocs I'd work with:

- VT-specific Fellowship funding through the [RS Interdisicplinary Graduate Education Group](https://aaec.vt.edu/content/dam/aaec_vt_edu/graduate/academic-information/applying/RSIGEP-info-2018.pdf), the [Global Change Center](https://globalchange.vt.edu/igc.html), and/or the [Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS)](https://ictas.vt.edu/). **The ICTAS fellowship is offered at the time of admission and requires a reference, so please reach out in advance if this is of interest so we can submit a compelling packet.**
- [Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowships for final year of dissertation writing](https://www.acls.org/programs/dcf/) -- typically due ~October
- [American Association of University Women (AAUW) - International Fellowships](https://www.aauw.org/resources/programs/fellowships-grants/current-opportunities/international/) -- due ~November

## Student/RA opportunity for Winter/Spring 2021

I'm a co-investigator on a new Stanford Impact Labs Grant ([link here](https://impact.stanford.edu/environmental-protection-all)) and am looking to recruit a student to work with me on evaluating determinants of chronic noncompliance (focusing on the Clean Water and possibly also the Safe Drinking Water Act). If you're skilled or interested in the causes, correlates, and consequences of environmental governance and crime, please reach out.

For the Winter 2021 in particular, I'm looking for a PhD student or academically-interested predoc to help systematically analyze publicly-available data that knowledgeable government partners have suggested as anecdotally associated with regulatory noncompliance. R or Python coding skills and coding sample required, SQL/PostgreSQL skills also preferred. Current opening offers a modest stipend, but ongoing and more funding opportunities may exist thereafter if interests and skills align, as ample research opportunities exist in this space.
