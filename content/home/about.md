I’m an Assistant Professor in [Virginia Tech’s Agricultural and Applied Economics Department](https://aaec.vt.edu/). I’m also a faculty affiliate of the VT [Remote Sensing Graduate Education Group](https://rsigep.frec.vt.edu/), the [Global Change Center](https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/), the [Center for Advanced Innovation in Agriculture](https://caia.cals.vt.edu/), as well as the Stanford [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/). 

My research centers on **environment, development, and agriculture**, with a focus on how advances in remote sensing and machine learning can help equitably enhance environmental compliance in the US and improve programs to manage weather risk around the globe.

Previously, I was a postdoc in the [Markets, Risk, and Resilience (MRR) Innovation Lab](https://basis.ucdavis.edu/) of the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis, following my Ph.D. from the [Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources](https://pangea.stanford.edu/eiper) (E-IPER) at Stanford.

Before grad school, I was a research analyst at [Climate Policy Initiative](https://climatepolicyinitiative.org/), where I worked on renewable energy finance in the US and tropical land use following my studies of economics and environmental science at UNC-Chapel Hill. I’m also a licensed [amateur radio operator](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/amateur-radio-service) (call sign K6NMI).
