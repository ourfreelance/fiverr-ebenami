I’m an Assistant Professor in Virginia Tech’s Agricultural and Applied Economics Department. I’m also a faculty affiliate of the VT Remote Sensing Graduate Education Group, the Global Change Center, the Center for Advanced Innovation in Agriculture, as well as the Stanford RegLab. 

My research centers on environment, development, and agriculture, with a focus on how advances in remote sensing and machine learning can help equitably enhance environmental compliance in the US and improve programs to manage weather risk around the globe.

Previously, I was a postdoc in the Markets, Risk, and Resilience (MRR) Innovation Lab of the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at the University of California, Davis, following my Ph.D. from the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) at Stanford.

Before grad school, I was a research analyst at Climate Policy Initiative, where I worked on renewable energy finance in the US and tropical land use following my studies of economics and environmental science at UNC-Chapel Hill. I’m also a licensed amateur radio operator (call sign K6NMI).
